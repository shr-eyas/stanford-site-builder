# Research

Our research spans several key areas in robotics and embodied AI, with a focus on enabling robots to learn and adapt in real-world environments.

## Robot Learning

We develop algorithms that enable robots to learn complex manipulation skills from demonstrations, simulations, and real-world interactions. Our approaches combine imitation learning, reinforcement learning, and foundation models.

## Dexterous Manipulation

Manipulation with multi-fingered hands and soft grippers remains one of the grand challenges in robotics. We work on perception, planning, and control methods for dexterous manipulation tasks.

## Human-Robot Interaction

Robots must work alongside and assist humans effectively. Our research addresses shared autonomy, intent prediction, and natural communication interfaces between humans and robots.

## Sim-to-Real Transfer

Training robots in simulation offers scalability and safety, but transferring learned behaviors to real robots is challenging. We develop domain adaptation and domain randomization techniques to bridge this gap.

## Foundation Models for Robotics

Large language models and vision-language models offer new opportunities for robot learning. We investigate how to leverage these foundation models for task specification, planning, and skill learning.
